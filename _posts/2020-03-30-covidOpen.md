# Fight against Global Pandemic


## Summary
We have seen an unprecidented collaborative and open movement in this fight againt Covid pandemic, in all aspects.
Ranging from Genomic sequencing of the virus itself to, Community guidelines to help prevent the outbreak.

When the new coronavirus (formally known as SARS-CoV-2) was identified in China in January, scientists around the world were ready to respond. The virusâ€™s entire genetic makeup, or genome, was published [online](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30251-8/fulltext) within days!

The collaborative efforts of engineers, designers and enterprenures has made possible technological tools like the 100$ Ventilor and the 3D printed vaulves that tackles the bottlenecks faced by the healthcare infrastructure.

However,
The amount of resources, portals, groups, tools, apps and ofcource Dashboards are almost overwhelming.

Also, with such speedy science we get higher error rate. The research papers aren't peer reviwerd, the data is not referenced (and hence might as well be opinions) and equipments I fear are not tested OK.

The self-isolation, a great and nessasary tactic, also requires a psycological analysis to cater to this sudden change of environment and lifestyle.

We here at Akriya Technologies, decided not to add yet another tool, dashboard, data sheet to the mix, but to add value to the numerous projects jumpstarted around us and use this precious time to expand our knowledge base.

This post, will link and discuss few projects, papers and tools that we found usefull/intrersting/intreging for us and our loved ones.
Hope you benifit from it too.

## Open Web
This category will focus on web based portal and tools. 

## Open Broadcast  
This category will focus on someof the great content peices created by YouTubers/Cinematographers.

## Open Hardware
This category will focus on Engineering projects that are making a difference.


<!-- 
## Recommendations/Best Practices
* Topics only lowercase, numbers and dashes.

* Topic stub from Left to Right :: General to specific

![MQTT Topic Stub L2R Flow](\assets\images\docs\mqtt_flow_gen_to_specfic.png)

* While Subscribing, multi-level subscriptions (using `#`) are highly discouraged. Use single level wild-card (using `+`) for stubs like DEVICE_STUB on open listners.

* Use MAC address if possible as DEVICE_STUB.
