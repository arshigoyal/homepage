# Fight against Global Pandemic


## Summary
We have seen an unprecedented collaborative and open movement in this fight against COVID pandemic, in all aspects.
Ranging from Genomic sequencing of the virus itself to, Community guidelines to help prevent the outbreak.

When the new coronavirus (formally known as SARS-CoV-2) was identified in China in January, scientists around the world were ready to respond. The virusâ€™s entire genetic makeup, or genome, was published [online](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30251-8/fulltext) within days!

The collaborative efforts of engineers, designers and entrepreneurs have made possible technological tools like the 100$ Ventilator and the 3D printed valves that tackle the bottlenecks faced by the healthcare infrastructure.

However,
The number of resources, portals, groups, tools, apps and of course Dashboards are almost overwhelming.

Also, with such speedy science, we get higher error rate. The research papers aren't peer reviewed, the data is not referenced (and hence might as well be opinions) and equipment I fear are not tested OK.

The self-isolation, a great and necessary tactic, also requires a psychological analysis to cater to this sudden change of environment and lifestyle.

We here at Akriya Technologies decided not to add yet another tool, dashboard, datasheet to the mix, but to add value to the numerous projects jumpstarted around us and use this precious time to expand our knowledge base.

This post will link and discuss a few projects, papers and tools that we found useful/interesting/intriguing for us and our loved ones.
Hope you benefit from it too.

## Open Web
This category will focus on web-based portal and tools. 
### Dashboards
* JHU Global Cases Portal
The Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) [Portal](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) was on of the first comprehensive ones to pop up on the internet. 
The raw data used to run this dashboard like many other is sourced from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

The website also links references to all the data sources that it uses to compile this information.

## Open Broadcast  
This category will focus on some of the great content pieces created by YouTubers/Cinematographers.

## Open Hardware
This category will focus on Engineering projects that are making a difference.

## Closing Statements
Some thoughts I wanted to get out there along with this text.
* If you are planning to create/work on a tool/resource/app/dashboard make it open source. Use platforms like GitLabs or Github to maintain. A Trello-like board to help people understand the current status, get onboarded fast.

* Times are what they are. Think of this as an adventure, a story you get tell your grandkids, the time when the entire world was on lockdown. Make it a good story, smile.

* We can curb miss-information, by flooding the mediums with factual information, with references. Do share information, but only what you have firsthand, marking yourself as reference. IF you are reposting, fact check by exploring the references and then repost. No technology can solve miss-information, humans can, humans are the ones that lie.
