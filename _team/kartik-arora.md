Hola, I am Kartik and thanks for taking the time to read this!

Just after graduation in 2015, I worked for Bing Search Engine team for a couple of years and since then have been working on my own venture here in Noida. 
We work as a product house, who also provide specialized services if and when needed, in the domain of Web Technologies and IoT.

I am an aspiring developer advocate, DIY enthusiast, a little extrovert and also a flexible opinionated guy.
