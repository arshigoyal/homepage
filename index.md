Enthusiastic and self-driven Master of Science in Data Science student at the University of Washington, with 2 years of experience in Pharmaceutical Analytics.

Inspired by the "No Free Lunch Theorem", I am on a constant drive to research and develop paradigms that solve real world problems.

My expertise includes data engineering, data analysis, machine learning modeling and web-development. Previously, I worked for 2 years with Axtria, a Pharmaceutical Analytics Company. My work centered around efficient communication with the client and collaboration with vendors to deliver high-quality and easy-to-understand analytics to the client and help them understand the dynamics of their marketing channels. I have published 1 research paper on Click-Through Rate Prediction. I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful individual who maintains a positive proactive attitude when faced with adversity. Currently, I am seeking for full-time opportunities that allow me to hone the skills that I have developed during my academic and professional experiences.
