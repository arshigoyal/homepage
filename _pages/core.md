## Who am I?
A recent MBA graduate from IIM Bangalore, I'm actively looking for new opportunities in product management. 

The program at IIMB provided me with a ton of opportunity in working collaboratively and a working knowledge of areas in business and management like business development, strategy, finance, marketing and sales. 

I've also completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Delhi, and have a strong technical background and work experience. I've worked with various programming languages (C++, Java, Python), statistical modelling tools (Matlab, R, Excel, SPSS), and databases (SQL, Oracle, Redis) and would comfortable in picking up new software and tools. 

I have two years of work experience at Samsung Research India, contributing to the System Software and Server Development teams there. I've also worked as a part time research consultant at Worldquant LLC while I was studying at IIT Delhi, and had several internships at corporates like ACT Fibernet, Softage Information Technology and Kritikal Solutions.

This experience really helps me ship an all-round product, and collaborate and communicate effectively with various related teams in business and technology.
